NumPy is a library for the Python programming language.NumPy is basically numerical Python. It adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
NumPy is used for the processing of arrays 99% of the times.
NumPy addresses the slowness problem partly by providing multidimensional arrays and functions and operators that operate efficiently on arrays, requiring rewriting some code, mostly inner loops, using NumPy.


Advantages 
NumPy is meant for creating homogeneous n-dimensional arrays (n = 1..n). Unlike Python lists, all elements of a NumPy array should be of same type. so the following code is not valid if data type is provided.
NumPy uses much less memory to store data.
